# Dragon-Power
I created a plugin a while back for a loose Fairy Tail server, the dragons I programmed was fun so this is the sameish system but improved upon

# How the plugin works
This plugin is NOT currently designed for a normal server due to no restrictions on the player's powers
The dragons are not balanced and while they may be some day they'd be really overpowered and could easilly detroy a server

Anyway, the shift or sneak key (I'll mention shift as sneaking as that's the default key)
The shift key is the modifier key to enable your dragon powers (or dragon accelerated action)

# Powers
The powers documentation is correct as of 20/05/15 (DD/MM/YY)

Each different type of dragon has different types of powers, currently you can switch dragons by saying !<dragon type> in chat, for example you can turn into a fire dragon by saying !fire in chat, this will be changed in a later build

## Fire dragon powers
Shift+Left click is a fireball action, the speed is the fireball is based on your velocity, you go faster, so will the fireball.
Shift+Jump is a flight action, currently this action is the same for all dragons, it allows you to fly into the air, while holding shift and aiming up you go higher but once you look down you start going down, this allows you to control yourself in flight.

## Earth dragon powers
Shift+Left click targets a block in the wild and prepells all blocks in a two block radius into the air.
Shift+Jump is a flight action, currently this action is the same for all dragons, it allows you to fly into the air, while holding shift and aiming up you go higher but once you look down you start going down, this allows you to control yourself in flight.
Attacking a mob will case them entirely in dirt, this will allow the earth dragon, once near another player or mob, to deal more damage using the earth around them as a weapon, dirt is chosen as anyone can break it so it won't kill you instantly.

## Water dragon powers
Shift+Left click unleases a torrent of water where the dragon is aiming
Shift+Jump is a flight action, currently this action is the same for all dragons, it allows you to fly into the air, while holding shift and aiming up you go higher but once you look down you start going down, this allows you to control yourself in flight.

# Git Workflow
The workflow of this project uses the master branch as the current development branch and stable versions are branched out.
